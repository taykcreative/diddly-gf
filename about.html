                    <p>For over a decade I have been plagued with Celiac disease, which means I had to say goodbye to gluten.  While there are many gluten-free options out that weren’t available years ago, there was really nothing out there that was easily available fresh and without preservatives.  I spent the last five years developing recipes for myself so that I too could go to a deli and enjoy a delicious sandwich.  Or go to a restaurant and have a hamburger that was on a bun just as good, if not better than the gluten ones served in restaurants.  Don’t get me wrong, a lot of places offer a few gluten free options here and there, but what are you eating?  Likely it has either been frozen and was thawed for you, or it has a lot of preservatives in it.  Either way, I have found them to be dry, dense and most of them fall apart while you are eating them. That is no way to enjoy the experience of a meal.</p>

                    <p>It is my pleasure to now offer my tried and true gluten free recipes made into easy to use mixes so that you too can eat gluten free without feeling like you are.  My mixes are made from ingredients that are natural, gluten free, have no preservatives and no GMO’s (Genetically Modified Organisms).  I sell my mixes in bulk, so that you can easily make as little or as many of my products as you need, fresh daily.  You can easily make a sandwich or hamburger roll with very little work and time.  (Most of that time being either dough rising or actually baking.)  Out comes a very fresh roll that doesn’t fall apart, is soft and springy and tastes wonderful.  My pizza crust mix makes a thick and chewy pizza crust, not a cracker thin one like those available elsewhere.  My cakes can be made as a whole cake or you can make 1-24 cupcakes at a time.  All very easily and extremely delicious!</p>

                    <p>Very shortly I will be offering mixes for delicious and decadent cinnamon rolls and cookies.  These will all be bulk mixes that you can keep on hand to make one or many of my delicious products.</p>

                    <p>Enjoy!</p>
